# SQ-HYPE
This is a modified HYPE hydrological and water quality modelling tool (Version 5.5.1) that transforms the differential equations used by HYPE to solve percolation, lateral soil fluxe, and evapotranspiration into a state-space formulation and solves the fluxes generated from all soil layers using operator-splitting or sequential numerical solver. This version of HYPE is different from the original version because, unlike th eoriginal version, it is implemented after a state-space tranformation of the HYPE differential equations. This version of HYPE is referred to as SQ-HYPE.
